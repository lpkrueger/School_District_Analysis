## Discoveries

Montgomery High School has the most students at 2038, and Chang High School has the least at 171. 

There were 1968 students missing a reading score and 982 students missing a math score. This could potentially taint the reading and math score data analyses. 

Grade 11-12's average reading score of 84.3 is significanly higher than the grade 9's at 69.2. 

A student from Dixon High School had the lowest reading score of all students in the dataset at 10.5, which is well below the 25th percentile of 62.2. 

Charter schools and public schools have similar budgets at $872,625 and $911,195 respectively. Yet charter school students have higher average math scores than public school students in every grade except 12th. 


## Additional Worthwhile Analysis

It would be worthwile to discover if there were certain schools that reported reading scores and/or math scores at a different rate. This could inform other potential issues with budget, reporting, or other administrative elements. 

Learning how school budget correlates to student count and average grades could inform future bugetary and pedagogical areas for investment.
